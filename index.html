    <p class="description">
          Hi, I am Eldrian C. Lining, 21 years old from Bancoro,  Buenavista, Marinduque, and I’m student of Information Technology at Marinduque State College. About myself, I love playing any kind of instrument and I also love to explore things about the course I took which is BSI/T. I'm a working student, it's hard but that's because as long as you have a dream you can do everything, and another one of my habits is vlogging because I lose my stress with those things.
